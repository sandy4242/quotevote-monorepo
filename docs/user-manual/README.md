## Welcome & Principles

### What is Quote.Vote?

Quote.Vote is a **text-first civic engagement platform** designed for thoughtful public dialogue. Unlike traditional social media, Quote.Vote emphasizes:

- **Targeted voting**: Vote on specific passages within posts, not just entire posts
- **Public by default**: Transparent discussions that encourage accountability
- **Reflection over reaction**: Thoughtful engagement rather than quick reactions
- **No ads, no algorithms**: Community-driven content discovery

### Core Values

- **Respectful participation**: Engage with ideas, not personal attacks
- **Transparency**: Public moderation notes and clear community guidelines
- **Accessibility**: Mobile-first design with screen reader support
- **Attribution**: Proper citation for quotes and AI-generated content

- **Note**: Use sparingly and constructively
